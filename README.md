# Antelope

This repository contains the summary data and the visualization scripts for the _Antelope_ project. The project uses Sense et al.'s (2016) behavioral procedure to estimate the forgetting rate of N=50 individuals, and the EEG analysis procedures of Prat et al. (2016; http://github.com/UWCDDL/QEEG) to estimate the spectral EEG characteristics of the same individual.

The figures here report a topopgrahic map view of the correlation between resting state EEG and forgetting rate across frequency bands and materials.
